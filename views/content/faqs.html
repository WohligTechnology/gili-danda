                                <br>
                                <h4>Is it mandatory for Mumbai School Sports Association (MSSA) member schools to take an NOC from MSSA to register with SFA?</h4>
                                <p>It is not mandatory for Mumbai School Sports Association (MSSA) member school to take an NOC from MSSA to register and participate. Kindly note, SFA Mumbai 2016 will be held for 20 days at a stretch for multiple sports. SFA Mumbai 2016 has been scheduled keeping the calenders of other school, district, state and national level tournaments in mind, thus there will be no clash with any other tournaments. We encourage students to play as many tournaments all round the year, in order to improve
                                    and excel in sports.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h4>Is it necessary/possible for the schools as well as participants to register at the same time?</h4>
                                <p>Yes, it is possible but not necessary. We understand that the school will be sending a contingent across different sports thus selecting the best players and filling out registration forms can be a time consuming process.
                                    It is preferable for a school to first send in their School Registration Form and send out their Sports and Student registration forms within 1 week.</p>
